idek im just bored<br>

### whats this?
in case your iq is also your age (4), this is a game site. it has emulators and apps and "search" tools to help you "search" the web freely (keyword FREELY) 
im trying my best to make you understand without making repllit goğŸ˜²ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ (i misspelled on purpose dont open an issue about it)
i worked pretty hard on this its a relatively good project, but its even better when you request new games.
